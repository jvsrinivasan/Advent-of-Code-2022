# Advent-of-Code-2022
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

I'm participating for the first time and I'm competing on the Mainframe Leaderboard for Advent of Code 2022. 
I'm intending to write all the solutions on COBOL. 

I'm using the Online COBOL compiler IDE on JDoodle (https://www.jdoodle.com/) to write the code for these puzzles.
